entitypicker
============

A jQuery plugin which utilizes UI autocomplete to allow for more advanced entity picking and editing. There's also a hastily-constructed [live demo](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/ErikNoren/entitypicker/blob/master/entitypickerdemo.html?v=5).

I will try to get more formal documentation up soon but here's some bullet points:
* Uses jQuery UI autocomplete for suggestions and user interaction.
* Entity containers are decorated with jQuery UI classes to give consistent UI.
* Multiple pickers can exists on a page.
* Pickers can be configured with the same or different lookup behaviors.
* The `source` configuration is used directly by jQuery autocomplete. Whatever parameters it supports, entity picker supports.
* Picking an entity generates a container HTML block with a hidden input element.
* The hidden input element's `name` attribute will be set by either the entitypicker element's id or the HTML5 style data attribute `data-input-name`.
* When used in a form the inputs are submitted just like any other group of inputs that share a name attribute.
* Can add single or a group of entities through a JavaScript call. This allows items to be prepopulated on page load (for example on an edit page).
* Has 2 events which fire when an entity is added or removed (entityadded, entityremoved).
* Can take a `maxUsers` parameter during configuration to set max entities that can be picked on each matched elements.
* Can read an HTML5 style data attribute data-max-users on the entitypicker element to set max entities that can be picked.
* Prevents duplicate entity picking by checking the value of the entity being added.
* The minimum number of characters to type before searching can be set on the entitypicker element using the HTML5 style data attribute `data-min-search-length`.
* The default behavior of the autocomplete box to change the value as the user navigates options is disabled. This was confusing for complex search types. A future release could expose this as a configuration option.

The current HMTL5 style data attributes which can be set on individual entitypicker elements (to which you attach the entitypicker) are:
* data-max-entities - sets the maximum number of entities a single picker can hold (default: -1 unlimited)
* data-min-search-length - sets the number of characters to type before a search begins (default: 2)
* data-input-name - sets the name attribute on the hidden input generated by picking an entity (if this isn't present, the id of the entitypicker element is used instead)

To use the picker you need to at least specify the `source` object for the autocomplete control. This is documented on the http://www.jQueryUI.com site. There is a demo HTML page available which shows how to consume a YQL endpoint.
